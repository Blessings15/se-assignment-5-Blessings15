Go to Line: Moves the cursor to a specific line number in the current file.

Go to Symbol: Opens a list of symbols (functions, classes, methods, etc.) in the current file for quick navigation.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

ROLES:

Language-specific Extensions: VS Code supports a wide range of programming languages out-of-the-box, but extensions can add advanced language features, syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (code completion), and debugging capabilities tailored to specific languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).

Debugging: Extensions can integrate with various debuggers (e.g., for Node.js, Python, PHP) to provide a seamless debugging experience directly within VS Code.

Testing: Extensions can enable running and managing unit tests, integration tests, and test coverage directly from the editor.

Linting and Formatting: Extensions can enforce code style guidelines, perform code analysis (linting), and auto-format code to maintain consistent coding practices.

Finding Extensions:
Open Extensions View:

Launch VS Code and locate the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for Extensions:

In the Extensions view, you'll see a search bar at the top. Use this to search for extensions by name, category (e.g., languages, themes, productivity), or functionality (e.g., Git integration, debugging tools).

MANAGING EXTENSIONS

Installed Extensions:

After installing extensions, they appear in the Installed section of the Extensions view. Here, you can see a list of all installed extensions.

Enable/Disable Extensions:

To disable an extension temporarily, click the gear icon next to the extension and select "Disable". Disabled extensions do not load or run in VS Code until re-enabled.
To enable a disabled extension, click "Enable" in the same menu.

Uninstall Extensions:

To remove an extension completely, click the gear icon next to the extension and select "Uninstall". Confirm the action if prompted. Uninstalling an extension removes it from your VS Code setup.

Update Extensions:

VS Code automatically checks for updates to installed extensions. If updates are available, you'll see an "Update" button next to the extension in the Extensions view. Click it to update the extension to the latest version.

Extension Settings:

Some extensions provide settings that you can customize to tailor their behavior to your needs. These settings can often be accessed via the gear icon next to the extension in the Extensions view or through the settings editor (Ctrl+,).
